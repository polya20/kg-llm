They are a readily stainable substance that consists of DNA and RNA, as well as various proteins. During mitotic division, chromatin granules become condensations, which means that they become compacted and紧密排列在一起， ready to be分裂成两个细胞或更多的细胞。

 chromatin is a complex of DNA and RNA that is stored in the cell's nuclear matrix. It is also known as nuclear DNA or DNA-DNA双螺旋结构。During interphase, the nuclear DNA is翼展复制， which means that it is分裂成两个相等大小的DNA分子， each of which is then翼展复制 again。

During mitosis, the DNA is解开， which allows for the cell to divide. The chromatin granules are then condensations, which help to ensure that the DNA is properly organized and ready to be分裂成两个细胞或更多的细胞。

 chromatin is important for the cell to function properly, as it helps to store genetic information and make it available for cell growth and development。 It is also involved in the regulation of gene expression, which means that it helps to control how the DNA is used。
surface, the extended two-dimensional outer boundary of a three-dimensional object; "they skimmed over the surface of the water"; "a brush small enough to clean every dental surface"; "the sun has no distinct surface" hypernym bounds, the line or plane indicating the limit or extent of something	Hypernym bounds are used in language analysis to define the relationships between words that share the same meaning. In the context of grammar and syntax, they are used to define the relationships between words in a sentence, such as whether one word is a subject, object, or verb.

For example, in the sentence "The cat is sleeping on the bed", the word "cat" is a hypernym of the word "sleeping", because they both refer to different things. "Sleeping" is a property or state of the cat, while "cat" is a specific object that the cat is in.

Hypernym bounds are also used in the context of word sense disambiguation, where they are used to ensure that the correct word is used when multiple words have the same meaning. This is important in many areas of language, such as writing, science, and business.

In summary, hypernym bounds are used to define the relationships between words in a sentence and to ensure that the correct word is used when multiple words have the same meaning.

"Who" is not a word that is commonly used with music. "Who" refers to a person or a group of people, and is not typically used in the context of music. However, if you are referring to "who" in the sense of "what" or "where", then you can use it in the context of music to refer to the structure or the organization of a song or melody.

For example, you could say "He put the stress on the wrong syllable in the wrong place, which caused the melody to sound unprofessional and unconvincing." In this case, "he" is the subject of the sentence, and "the stress" and "the wrong syllable" are the events or circumstances that are causing the problem.

qualifying, the grammatical relation that exists when a word qualifies the meaning of the phrase derivationally related form qualify, add a modifier to a constituent	In mathematics and science, a derivation is a method of reducing a higher-level concept to a lower-level one. For example, a derivation may involve reducing a complex equation to a simpler equation that can be easier to solve.

To qualify a derivation, you need to understand the original concept and how it was derived. For example, if you are taking a derivation of the Pythagorean theorem, you would need to understand the concept of Pythagorean theorem, including its three components: the length of the sides of a rightangle, the measure of the angle, and the relationship between the two measures.

To add a modifier to a constituent in a derivation, you would need to understand the context and the purpose of the modifier. For example, if you are using the term “Pythagorean theorem” to describe a relationship between the lengths of two sides, you could add a modifier such as “inequality” to clarify that the relationship is not only between the lengths of the sides, but also between their measures.

Overall, qualify and modifier are important concepts in mathematics and science that help to make our derivations more clear and accurate.

It refers to forms or structures that are related to each other by specific rules or relationships. For example, in the field of calculus, a derivative is a rate of change of a function, while a integral is a sum of functions over a certain region. These forms are derivationally related because they are both used to describe the behavior of functions and their changes.

Another example is the concept of power in mathematics, where a power is a function that increases with an exponent. For example, 2 to the power 3 means that the value of 2 raised to the 3rd power is 8. These forms are also derivationally related because they are used to describe the behavior of functions and their changes.

In addition to these examples, many other forms or structures in mathematics and science are also derivationally related, such as differential equations, sequences and series, and optimization problems. The study of derivationally related forms and quantities is called mathematical modeling and it is used to understand the behavior of complex systems and to design new ones.

For example, if a study were to find that "bank" and "financial institution" had a higher correlation with each other than with "customer," it could be argued that the study was based on a hypernym stipulation, which assumes that the relationship between the two words is meaningful and relevant to the study's goals.

entozoon, any of various parasites that live in the internal organs of animals (especially intestinal worms) hypernym parasite, an animal or plant that lives in or on a host (another animal or plant); it obtains nourishment from the host without benefiting or killing the host	The term "hypernym parasite" typically refers to a relationship between two different classes of organisms, such as animals or plants, where one class lives on or within the other. In this context, the host is the one that provides nourishment to the parasite, and the parasite is not benefitting from the host's resources, but rather using them to survive. Examples of hypernym parasite relationships include:

-   A virus that lives on the surface of a host cell and uses the host cell's resources to grow and replicate itself.
-   A plant that uses the resources of its host animal as food to grow and produce offspring.
-   A抖syTM, a type of parasitic worm that lives in the eggs of another worm and uses them as a host for its life cycle.

It's worth noting that this term is not commonly used in its original context of description of living on another host, but it can still be used in this sense to describe any living relationship between two organisms where one is provided with resources without benefitting from them.
absorber, (physics) material in a nuclear reactor that absorbs radiation derivationally related form absorb, become imbued; "The liquids, light, and gases absorb"	The term "absorb" can have a derived meaning when used with the word "imbue". According to this meaning, the word refers to a process in which a material or object吸收、捕获或传递能量或物质。In this context, the term "imbue" can be used to describe the process of becoming filled with or carrying something else, such as a liquid, light, or energy.

For example, the word "bucket" can be derived from the word "bucket" (即 "baggage"), which means "the thing that is carried or contains something". So, when we say that "the water in thebucket absorbed", we are saying that the water became filled with water from thebucket's contents.

同样地，当我们说 "the light in the room imbued the room with energy" 时，我们的意思是光线使房间充满了能量。 This means that the light energy became available in the room, or "imbued" the room with it.

因此，可以说 "the liquids, light, and gases absorb" 是指物质或物体吸收、捕获或传递能量或物质的过程，而 "the liquids, light, and gases" 则是这些过程所涉及的物质或物体。
oftenness, the number of occurrences within a given time period; "the frequency of modulation was 40 cycles per second"; "the frequency of his seizures increased as he grew older" hypernym rate, a magnitude or frequency relative to a time unit; "they traveled at a rate of 55 miles per hour"; "the rate of change was faster than expected"	The correcthypernym for "rate" is "velocity", as it refers to a magnitude or frequency relative to a time unit. In the first example, "55 miles per hour" is a rate of travel, while in the second example, "faster than expected" is a rate of change.
hind leg, the back limb of a quadruped has part hock-joint, tarsal joint of the hind leg of hoofed mammals; corresponds to the human ankle	The part hock-joint, tarsal joint, and MTP joint are all located on the hind legs of hoofed mammals, such as horses, dogs, and cats. These joints are responsible for allowing the animal to stand on its feet and move its legs. The human ankle also has a joint called the tarsal joint, but it is located on the lower leg instead of the upper leg as in the hoofed mammals. The tarsal joint corresponds to the horse's part hock-joint, which is the joint located at the bottom of the foot. This joint allows the horse to flex its foot andes together to take off and land on its feet.
transplant, be transplantable; "These delicate plants do not transplant easily" derivationally related form transplanting, the act of removing something from one location and introducing it in another location; "the transplant did not flower until the second year"; "too frequent transplanting is not good for families"; "she returned to Alabama because she could not bear transplantation"	The word "transplant" is derived from the拉丁 word " transposus," which means "to move or place forward." This word can be used to describe the act of moving or introducing something from one location to another.

In the examples you provided, "the transplant did not flower until the second year" and "too frequent transplanting is not good for families," the word " transplant" is used to describe the act of removing something from one location and introducing it in another location.

In the example you provided with the woman who returned toAlabama because she could not bear transplantation, " she" is the subject of the sentence, and " transplantation" is used to describe the act of moving someone or something from one place to another.

Overall, the word "transplant" is a derivative of the word "transposus," which is itself a derivative of the word "move." The act of transplantation is the movement or introduction of something from one location to another.
twin, bring two objects, ideas, or people together; "This fact is coupled to the other one"; "Matchmaker, can you match my daughter with a nice young man?"; "The student was paired with a partner for collaboration on the project" derivationally related form yoke, a connection (like a clamp or vise) between two things so they move together	The word " yoke " is a derived word from the Old English word "yeo" which means "with" or "between" and "wye" which means "two". So, "yeo" refers to a connection or bond between two things, specifically two objects or beings that are together and interact with each other.

The term " yoke " has since been used in many different fields and applications, including mechanics, agriculture, and business. It can also refer to a physical connection between two objects, such as a connection between two vehicles that allows them to move together.

In addition to its use in mechanics and agriculture, the word "yeo" has also been used in other fields, such as education and sports, to refer to a connection or bond between students or teams.

sitting, (photography) the act of assuming a certain position (as for a photograph or portrait); "he wanted his portrait painted but couldn't spare time for the sitting" hypernym movement, a change of position that does not entail a change of location; "the reflex motion of his eyebrows revealed his surprise"; "movement is a sign of life"; "an impatient move of his hand"; "gastrointestinal motility"	The hypernym for "move" is "motion." This word refers to a change of position that does not entail a change of location. "Reflex motion of his eyebrows" refers to a movement that occurs in response to a stimulus, while "impatience move of his hand" refers to a movement that is caused by the desire to move quickly. "gastrointestinal motility" refers to the physical activity of the food and beverage in the body's digestive system. All of these terms involve changes in position or movement, but they have different sources of origin or meaning.
naval commander, naval officer in command of a fleet of warships synset domain topic of war machine, the military forces of a nation; "their military is the largest in the region"; "the military machine is the same one we faced in 1991 but now it is weaker"	The topic of the war machine, or the military forces of a nation, can be a broad and complex one. It can include discussions of the tactics, strategies, and capabilities of the military, as well as the historical context and challenges of war.

The specific Synset you provided, "Their military is the largest in the region," is a sentence in a context of discussing the size and strength of the military of a particular nation in a region. This can be a significant topic, as the size and capabilities of the military can impact the overall security and stability of a region.

The sentence "the military machine is the same one we faced in 1991 but now it is weaker," is also a relevant topic, as it suggests that the military capabilities of a nation may have changed over time, but that the overall military machine, or "machine," remains the same. This can be a complex and nuanced topic, as the strength and capabilities of the military can be influenced by a variety of factors, including economic development, technological advancements, and the political and social environment of the nation.

Overall, the topic of the war machine and the military forces of a nation can be a complex and fascinating one, and discussions of these topics can provide valuable insights into the challenges and opportunities of international security and conflict.
watercraft, a craft designed for water transportation has part rudder, (nautical) steering mechanism consisting of a hinged vertical plate mounted at the stern of a vessel	The term "part rudder" refers to a component of anautical steering mechanism consisting of a hinged vertical plate mounted at the stern of a vessel. This component of the system helps to control the direction of the ship's flow of water through its channels and helps to turn the ship in response to changes in the wind and other environmental factors.
A rudder is a type of control system that is used to turn a ship. It consists of a vertical plate that is hinged at one end and connected to a system of lines and weights that are used to move the plate in response to changes in the wind and other environmental factors. This movement of the plate controls the flow of water through the ship's channels，从而 controlling the direction of the ship.
S rudder are commonly used in large ocean-going vessels, as they provide a more efficient and effective way to turn the ship in response to changing conditions. They are also used in smaller vessels such as pleasure ships and ferries, where space is limited and more subtle changes in wind direction are required.

It is not a term commonly used in the context of referring to a person's spiritual or emotional experiences, but rather a specific quality or characteristic of a human being.

The phrase "there was too much for one person to do" could be used to describe a situation where a person's capabilities or resources were limited by their circumstances or challenges. In this context, the term "soul" could be used to describe the additional capacity or abilities that a person with a soul has to offer, compared to a person without one.

puzzle, be uncertain about; think about without fully understanding or being able to decide; "We puzzled over her sudden departure" derivationally related form puzzlement, confusion resulting from failure to understand	derivational forms of confusion can result from failure to understand a concept or concept derived from it. For example, a person might not understand a concept of independence from a given source, such as a government or a company, and then be confused when they cannot make decisions or make decisions based on a source that is not independent.

Another example is the concept of derivation in mathematics. In mathematics, a derivation is a process of obtaining a new result by using the properties of an existing result and adding additional steps. For example, the derived result may be a new proof or equation that uses the properties of an earlier result to reach a new conclusion.

In summary, derivational forms of confusion can result from failure to understand a concept or concept derived from it, such as independence, independence from a source, or derivation in mathematics.
thawing, the process whereby heat changes something from a solid to a liquid; "the power failure caused a refrigerator melt that was a disaster"; "the thawing of a frozen turkey takes several hours" derivationally related form unthaw, become or cause to become soft or liquid; "The sun melted the ice"; "the ice thawed"; "the ice cream melted"; "The heat melted the wax"; "The giant iceberg dissolved over the years during the global warming phase"; "dethaw the meat"	The derived verb "dethaw" is related to the verb "unthaw" by means of derivation.

7. 昆虫 (such as蚂蚁，蜜蜂，蝴蝶)
8. 无脊椎动物 (such as神经元，细胞，细菌)
9. 软体动物 (such as章鱼，蛞蝓，蜗牛)
10. 节肢动物 (such as虾，蟹，蜘蛛，蝎子)

The order of animals is used in science to categorize living things into more specific groups, as well as to study the relationships between them. It is an important part of our understanding of the world around us and the ways in which life works.
energetic, possessing or exerting or displaying energy; "an energetic fund raiser for the college"; "an energetic group of hikers"; "it caused an energetic chemical reaction" also see enterprising, marked by imagination, initiative, and readiness to undertake new projects; "an enterprising foreign policy"; "an enterprising young man likely to go far"	These are allusions to the idea of an enterprising person, who is characterized by imagination, initiative, and a willingness to undertake new projects. They also refer to an enterprising foreign policy, which is one that is based on creativity and innovative thinking, and may result in the development of new strategies and policies that can help the country achieve its goals. Finally, the phrase "an enterprising young man likely to go far" is a reference to someone who is willing to take risks and go after what they believe is their right, and who may have the potential to achieve great things.
exhume, dig up for reburial or for medical investigation; of dead bodies derivationally related form exhumation, the act of digging something out of the ground (especially a corpse) where it has been buried	The English word "exhumation" is derived from the Germanic word "exhume," which means "to uncover" or "to lift up." The act of digging someone out of the ground where they have been buried is called "exhumation."

In history, the practice of exhumation was used often in the past to uncover bodies that had been accidentally埋得太久， or to search for bodies that were missing or were believed to be buried in a secret location. It was also used during the search for the body of President John F. Kennedy on November 22, 1963, after his assassination in Dallas, Texas.

Today, the act of exhumation is still used in many countries to search for missing people, and it is also used in cases of suspicious death or medical emergencies. However, the use of exhumation has been controversial, as it can lead to the discovery of important evidence or the Identification of a person's remains.
snobbism, the trait of condescending to those of lower social status hypernym lordliness, overbearing pride evidenced by a superior manner toward inferiors	The term "hypernym" refers to a word or concept that is too closely related to another word or concept to require a separate word. In this context, "hypernym lordliness" would refer to a word or concept that combines the characteristics of "hypernym" with "lordliness," which is a quality of superiority and傲慢. One possible hypernym that might include these characteristics is "hypernym lout," which could refer to a person who exhibits overbearing pride and a superior manner toward others. However, it's important to note that this term is not widely used and may not accurately describe the specific quality you are referring to.
fearful, lacking courage; ignobly timid and faint-hearted; "cowardly dogs, ye will not aid me then"- P.B.Shelley derivationally related form fearfulness, the trait of being afraid	Fear is a negative emotion that can be derived from the brain's need to protect us from potential harm or threat. It is related to a number of mental health conditions, including anxiety and depression.

There is some evidence that fear can be related to the brain's development during early life. For example, research has shown that children who are exposed to fear-based information in the womb may be born with a greater need for fear-related processing in the brain, which can lead to fear-related emotions in later life.

In addition to the development of the brain, there is also evidence that certain foods, stress, and certain types of music can affect fear levels. For example, some studies have found that exposure to stress or music with high levels of fear-related sounds can increase fear levels.

However, it's important to note that fear is a complex emotion and not all people experience it in the same way or at the same rate. Additionally, not all mental health conditions are caused by fear alone and other factors may also be involved.
population, the people who inhabit a territory or state; "the population seemed to be well fed and clothed" hypernym people, (plural) any group of human beings (men or women or children) collectively; "old people"; "there were at least 200 people in the audience"	The hypernym for "people" is "persons" or "students."

In the modern world, nutrition is a complex process that is affected by a wide range of factors, including the composition of the food we eat, the number and type of calories we consume, and the physical and mental development of our bodies. This process is carried out by various cells and tissues in the body, including the cells of the immune system, the cells of the brain and muscles, and the cells of the skin and bones. The process of nutrition is essential for the growth and development of organisms, as it provides the energy and materials needed to build and maintain the body's structures and functions. In animals, the process of nutrition is typically performed by cells called主机厂 (汽车主机厂) which are responsible for the production of food products, such as vegetables, fruits, meats, fish, eggs, dairy products, and more. In humans, the process of nutrition is performed by cells called enterocytes, which process food into nutrients, such as carbohydrates, proteins, and fats, that are then absorbed by the body. The absorption of these nutrients is performed by cells called enterocytes in the wall of the small intestine, and the transportation of these nutrients to their final destination, such as the muscles, brain, and heart, is performed by cells called neurons, cells of the immune system, and cells of the cardiovascular system. The process of nutrition is a complex and dynamic one, and it is affected by a wide range of factors, including the type and amount of food we eat, the physical and mental development of our bodies, and our overall health. By understanding the process of nutrition, we can take steps to improve our health and make better decisions about the food we eat.

This could be used to传达 the message that每个人都有机会获得新的机会， for example, to grow and develop as individuals, or to make a positive impact on the world.

In this example, the allegory is not about the actual event of Jesus' birth, but about how it can be used to convey a moral message. The allegory is " allegorized" because it is used to illustrate a message that is more important than the actual event that it is based on.
ask, address a question to and expect an answer from; "Ask your teacher about trigonometry"; "The children asked me about their dead grandmother" derivationally related form questioner, someone who asks a question	A questioner is a person who asks a question. It is a derived concept from the word "question", which means to ask a question. So, a questioner is someone who uses the verb "to ask" to express the act of asking a question.
double, hit a two-base hit hypernym hit, cause to move by striking; "hit a ball"	The correct hypernym for "hit a ball" is "hit a ball," which is a verb that means to catch or hit a ball.

In graph theory, the edge of a graph is a concept that is used to define the connectivity of a graph, as well as to determine the properties of the graph, such as the number of edges and the number of nodes.

In computer图形学， the edge of a surface is a concept that is used to create逼真 surfaces in computer graphics, by using lines and edges to define the shape of the surface. Edges are often used to connect objects on the surface, and they can also be used to define the behavior of surfaces and objects in space.

The edge of a surface is a derived concept in geometry that is used to define the shape and properties of a surface in terms of the underlying space. It is a fundamental concept in many fields of science and engineering, and it is an important tool for understanding the nature of space and the behavior of objects in it.
scurf, a thin flake of dead epidermis shed from the surface of the skin derivationally related form exfoliate, cast off in scales, laminae, or splinters	The word " exfoliate" has a derived meaning related to the process of reducing or摧毁 something to its basic components. The word comes from the拉丁语 "ex创制" ("from creation"), which means "to create or develop." In the context of technology, it refers to the process of reducing a complex system to its underlying components, which can then be understood or simplified.

The word "scale" is also a derived term related to the process of measurement. It comes from the拉丁语 "s scale" ("of a scale"), which means "on a scale." In the context of measurement, "scale" refers to a system of measurement that is made up of multiple numbers or levels, such as a weight scale or a size scale.

The word " laminae" is a derived term that refers to thin，分层 structures made of a material. It comes from the拉丁语 "lamellae" ("layers"), which means "layers."

platichthys, a genus of Pleuronectidae hypernym fish genus, any of various genus of fish	Hypernyms are groups of words that are related in meaning, structure, or origin. One common type of hypernym is a hypernym of a fish species, which is a group of fish that share a common name or characteristics. There are many different fish species with different names and characteristics, and many of these species have their own genera. Some examples of fish genera include:

-   Coelacanth: A fish species from the family Latimeriatidae, which includes other species such as the lungfish and the false lungfish.
-   Dragonfish: A species of ocean fish from the family Dragonidae, which includes other species such as the sablefish and the sea dragon.

implode, burst inward; "The bottle imploded" derivationally related form implosion, the initial occluded phase of a stop consonant	The initial occlusion phase of a stop consonant is derivationally related to the occlusion phase of a fricative consonant. Both occlusion phases are characterized by the process of reducing the air pressure in the sound wave at the point of contact between the mouth and nose. However, the way in which this air pressure is reduced is different in each case.

The occlusion phase of a fricative consonant is characterized by a sudden decrease in air pressure at the point of contact between the front of the mouth and the airstream. This results in a sudden decrease in sound height and a change in the sound's intonation. fricatives are typically produced by closing the mouth fully or slightly, which causes the airstream to contact the front of the mouth in a specific area.

In contrast, the occlusion phase of a stop consonant is characterized by a decrease in air pressure at the point of contact between the mouth and nose as well as a decrease in air flow. This results in a sudden decrease in sound height and a change in the sound's intonation. stop consonants are typically produced by closing the mouth fully or slightly, which causes the airstream to contact the front of the mouth in a specific area. The air flow through the mouth during a stop consonant is typically much less than that during a fricative, which results in a different sound quality and intonation.

Overall, the occlusion phase of a stop consonant is derivedly related to the occlusion phase of a fricative because both processes involve a decrease in air pressure at the point of contact between the mouth and nose. However, the specific ways in which this air pressure is reduced are different in each case, which results in a different sound quality and intonation.
spike, add alcohol to (beverages); "the punch is spiked!" derivationally related form fortification, the addition of an ingredient for the purpose of enrichment (as the addition of alcohol to wine or the addition of vitamins to food)	Fortification is a process in which an ingredient is added to a food product to enrich it with a nutrient or improve its flavor or texture. It is often used to add a certain amount of a nutrient or component to a food to meet a specific need or demand in the population. For example, the addition of维生素C to orange juice can help to increase the amount of this nutrient in the juice, which can be beneficial for people who are unable to consume it through their diet.

The process of derivation, on the other hand, refers to the way in which a chemical or physical reaction occurs. For example, the derivation of alcohol from the compound夷陵碱 is a chemical reaction that takes place during the production of wine. The addition of an ingredient, such as alcohol, to wine during the production process can enrich it with this nutrient, making it more valuable.

In summary, fortification is a process in which an ingredient is added to a food product to enrich it with a nutrient or improve its flavor or texture, and derivation is the process of occurring during the production of a chemical or physical reaction.
pterodactylidae, a reptile family in the order Pterosauria hypernym reptile family, a family of reptiles	The reptile family is a hypernym of the class Allurapoda, which is a class of animals characterized by the presence of scales on their body.

Some of the most well-known members of the reptile family include the turtle, the鳄鱼， the蛇， and the蜥蜴. The reptile family plays a important role in the evolution of the animal kingdom and is responsible for a large number of different species.
uninteresting, arousing no interest or attention or curiosity or excitement; "a very uninteresting account of her trip" also see unexciting, not exciting; "an unexciting novel"; "lived an unexciting life"	I'm sorry, but I'm not sure which specific person or group you are referring to. The phrase "unexciting, not exciting" and "lived an unexciting life" can be used in various contexts and by different individuals. Some people may see these phrases as贬义词， while others may see them as中性 or褒义词.

As for what/who see these phrases as贬义词， I would say that these phrases are often used to describe a person's life who is not exciting or interesting to others. They may feel that their experiences or life choices are not up to par with the standards of excitement and adventure that others expect from life.

However, it's important to note that these phrases can also be used in a more positive context, as a way to describe a person who has overcome challenges and has made meaningful contributions to their community or society.

Overall, it's important to be aware of the different ways in which language can be used and to be able to分辨 between a negative and positive meaning behind certain phrases and words.
autotrophic organism, plant capable of synthesizing its own food from simple organic substances derivationally related form autotrophic, of or relating to organisms (as green plants) that can make complex organic nutritive compounds from simple inorganic sources by photosynthesis	The autotrophic organisms that can make complex organic nutritive compounds from simple inorganic sources by photosynthesis are related to each other by a process of derivation. Autotrophic organisms are those that lack a need for input from other living organisms, and can produce their own food by means of photosynthesis. This means that they require no other living things to grow and maintain themselves. The relationship between autotrophic organisms and other organisms is known as derivation. This process of derivation is related to the way that living things grow and develop, as it involves the ability of an organisms to use input from other living things to grow and change. In the case of autotrophic organisms, the input they require is simple inorganic sources such as light and carbon dioxide, which they use to make ATP, a type of energy storage compound, and organic nutritive compounds such as carbohydrates. The relationship between autotrophic organisms and other organisms is a complex one, and is influenced by a variety of factors such as the availability of input materials, the ability of the organisms to evolve new functions, and the competitive interactions between organisms.

twitch, make an uncontrolled, short, jerky motion; "his face is twitching" hypernym move reflexively, move in an uncontrolled manner	The appropriate hypernym for "who" is "whom," and the appropriate hypernym for " reflexively" is "reflexively."

A hypernym is a word that forms a complete noun phrase by adding the word "-ly" to the end. "Who" and "whom" are both hypernyms that form complete noun phrases by adding the word "-ly" to the end. "Reflexively" is not a hypernym, as it does not form a complete noun phrase by adding the word "-ly" to the end.

In general, hypernyms are words that form complete noun phrases by adding the word "-ly" to the end. "Who" and "whom" are two common hypernyms, and "reflexively" is not one of them.

liberalize, make liberal or more liberal, of laws and rules verb group liberalize, become more liberal; "The laws liberalized after Prohibition"	The word " liberalize" can refer to a number of things, but it typically refers to a process of making something more open to change or能够接受新的思想和理念. It can also mean to make something more democratic or free-flowing.

In the context of politics and governance, " liberalism" refers to a political philosophy that emphasizes individual rights, human的自由和平等， and the importance of public education, social services, and environmental protection. The term "ultra-liberal" can also be used to describe a more extreme form of this philosophy.

In the context of law, " Prohibition" was a measure passed in the United States in 1919 to eliminate the use of alcohol in the country. This measure was aimed at reducing public safety by making alcohol consumption more dangerous and increasing the likelihood of accidents. After the law was passed, the laws regarding the production, sale, and transportation of alcohol were made more liberal, as it became easier to make and sell alcohol again. This process was also known as "reform" or "de戒除"。
copying, an act of copying hypernym repetition, the act of doing or performing again	Hypernym repetition is the use of the same word or phrase multiple times in a sentence or paragraph, often as a form of emphasis or to build meaning. It can be achieved using different words or phrases, as well as by changing the context of the sentence or paragraph.
Some examples of hypernym repetition include:
- "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog" (using "quick" and "brown" twice in the same sentence to emphasize the color contrast between the fox and the dog)
- "I love to read books before going to bed" (using "read" twice in the same sentence to emphasize the act of reading)
- "The sun sets in the west and rises in the east" (using the same word "east" twice to build the sense of movement from the sun's rotation on its axis)
- "She cooked a delicious meal for her family" (using "cook" twice in the same sentence to emphasize the act of cooking)
Hypernym repetition is a common feature of language and can help to强化 meaning and make sentences more concise and effective.
exuberance, overflowing with eager enjoyment or approval derivationally related form triumph, to express great joy; "Who cannot exult in Spring?"	The derivational form of the verb "t triumph" is "ttrive." To express great joy, you could say, "Who cannot triumph in Spring?"
rectilinear regression, the relation between variables when the regression equation is linear: e.g., y = ax + b hypernym statistical regression, the relation between selected values of x and observed values of y (from which the most probable value of y can be predicted for any value of x)	In statistical regression, a hypernym refers to a specific type of relationship between two variables, where the other variable(s) is(are) also known as the dependent variable(s). In statistical regression, the independent variable(s) are measured or estimated variables that can vary in value, and the dependent variable(s) are the outcome or result of the variation in the independent variable(s).

For example, in a regression model, one might假设 that the independent variable (e.g., gender) impacts the dependent variable (e.g., age), where the more male the independent variable, the more advanced the dependent variable. In this case, gender is a hypernym of age.

Hypernyms are often used to refer to relationships between multiple variables, where each variable is a hypernym of another variable(s). This can be useful for analyzing complex data sets and understanding the underlying patterns and relationships.
lubricate, apply a lubricant to; "lubricate my car" hypernym make full, make full, also in a metaphorical sense; "fill a container"; "fill the child with pride"	The word "make full" can be a verb or a hypernym (a word that refers to itself as a word) for the word "full". As a verb, it means to fill a container with a certain amount of something, such as water or food. For example, "I'll make full use of the library's resources" means that I'll make full use of all the library's books.

As a hypernym for "full", "make full" refers to a state or condition in which something is complete, perfect, or at the end of its journey. For example, "The child's pride was made full by his achievements" means that the child's pride was complete because of his achievements.

It's worth noting that the metaphoric sense of "fill the child with pride" is not a clear example of the use of "make full" as a hypernym. The verb "fill" refers to making something full, but the metaphor is not clear about what the child is being filled with or what the container is. It's more likely that this is a clear example of the use of "make full" as a verb meaning to complete or perfect something.
placate, cause to be more favorably inclined; gain the good will of; "She managed to mollify the angry customer" hypernym tranquillize, make calm or still; "quiet the dragons of worry and fear"	The hypernym "tranquilize" refers to the process of making someone or something calm or still.

Hades was the god of death and冥王 of the underworld, and he was often depicted as a personification of death.

In popular culture, Hades is often associated with the concept of death and dying, as in the saying, "Death walked the streets of the plague-bound city." This saying is often used to describe the idea that死亡 is a natural and normal part of life, and that it is not something to be afraid of or avoiding.

Hades was also the subject of a famous poem by the ancient Greek poet Odysseus, in which he describes his journey through the underworld and the experiences of the various souls there. This poem, called the "Odyssey," is often considered one of the greatest works of ancient Greek literature.

realm, a domain in which something is dominant; "the untroubled kingdom of reason"; "a land of make-believe"; "the rise of the realm of cotton in the south" hypernym sphere, a particular environment or walk of life; "his social sphere is limited"; "it was a closed area of employment"; "he's out of my orbit"	The hypernym for "sphere" is "world," which refers to a particular environment or walk of life that is unique and separate from other environments. For example, one's socialSphere is different from one's workSphere, and one's personalSphere is unique to one's life.
walk on air, feel extreme happiness or elation derivationally related form jubilation, a feeling of extreme joy	jubilation and the feeling of extreme joy are not directly related in the way that one is derived from the other.

Jubilation is a feeling of extreme happiness and contentment that can be experienced during certain circumstances or events. It is often described as a state of well-being that is beyond compare, and can last for a short or long time. It is often associated with positive events, such as achieving a goal, meeting a loved one, or sharing a special moment with someone.

The feeling of extreme joy, on the other hand, is a specific mental state that can be caused by various factors, such as excitement, contentment, or joy at an event or achievement. It can also be experienced during certain circumstances or situations, such as the moment when a person feels a deep sense of connection with their family or friends.

However, it's worth noting that both jubilation and joy can be derived from the same basic emotional responses, such as the release of chemicals in the brain when we experience positive emotions. So, for example, a person might feel jubilation after achieving a goal that brought them great joy, or might feel joy when they are sharing their成功 with others.

In conclusion, both jubilation and joy can be derived from the same emotional responses, but they are not directly related in the way that one is derived from the other.
leptopteris, including some ferns sometimes placed in genus Todea member meronym todea superba, New Zealand with pinnate fronds and a densely woolly stalks; sometimes included in genus Todea	The meronym "todea" refers to a family of plants called the Todea family, which is a family of about 100 species of small, round, green plants native to New Zealand. The family is often called the "kiwifruit" plants because of the way they produce fruit that is similar to the kiwi fruit that is native to New Zealand.

The specific species in the Todea family that you mentioned, "Todea superba," is a member of this family and is known for its pinnate frond and densely Woolly stalks. It is also sometimes included in the genera Todea and Cochlearia, which together make up the Todea complex.

Overall, the Todea family is a small and unique family of plants that are well-suited to their environment in New Zealand. They are often used forage and are important members of the local food system.
sadhe, the 18th letter of the Hebrew alphabet hypernym letter of the alphabet, the conventional characters of the alphabet used to represent speech; "his grandmother taught him his letters"	The hypernym for the letter "A" is " Language." This is because the letter is used to represent different sounds and types of speech in different languages. In English, the letter "A" represents the sound of the airstream when it is spoken. However, in other languages, the letter may represent a different sound or even a different word. For example, in the Japanese language, the letter "A" represents the sound of the "a"音， which is a short sound that is used to express many different emotions and ideas.
stabber, someone who stabs another person derivationally related form stab, stab or pierce; "he jabbed the piece of meat with his pocket knife"	The verb "jab" is derived from the Old English word "jabban" which means to strike or touch with a sharp object, especially with a weapon.

field of honor, a region where a battle is being (or has been) fought; "they made a tour of Civil War battlefields" hypernym tract, an extended area of land	A hypernym tract is a term in graph theory used to refer to a set of hypernyms (hyperedges) that contain a common node. In other words, a hypernym tract is a set of edges that share a single node. In the context of computer science and artificial intelligence, hypernyms can refer to other nodes or concepts in a dataset that are related to the node being discussed.

For example, in a dataset of student learning outcomes, a hypernym tract might include nodes such as the class of a student, the subject of a course, the topic of a research paper, and the level of a program. Each of these nodes can be associated with multiple hyperedges, which means that the set of hypernyms for a given node can be large.

In the context of machine learning, hypernym tract analysis can be used to help identify important relationships between nodes in a dataset and to identify potential patterns or connections that could be useful for machine learning algorithms. This can be especially useful for tasks such as classification, regression, and machine translation, where there may be many potential hyperedges that could be relevant to a given node.
tell apart, mark as different; "We distinguish several kinds of maple" hypernym place, recognize as being; establish the identity of someone or something; "She identified the man on the 'wanted' poster"	What/Who hypernym place, recognize as being; establish the identity of someone or something; "She identified the man on the 'wanted' poster"?

spring, a light, self-propelled movement upwards or forwards derivationally related form leap, cause to jump or leap; "the trainer jumped the tiger through the hoop"	The phrase "the trainer jumps the tiger through the hoop" is a commonly used expression in English that is derived from the phrase "jumps over the bar" which means to clear a障碍物(如栏杆、桌子等) by跨越它。
The full phrase "the trainer jumps the tiger through the hoop" can be derived as follows:
"the trainer jumps over the bar" --> "the trainer clears the bar" --> "the trainer jumps the tiger through the hoop"
So, the phrase "the trainer jumps the tiger through the hoop" means that the trainer successfully jumps over a障碍物(如栏杆、桌子等) and clears it, thus enabling him/her to train a tiger.

For example, if we knew that a particular disease was highly contagious and if a person catches it, they might develop a high fever, feel sick, and need to be isolated for a period of time, we could use this information to extrapolate what might happen if a large number of people catch the disease. By understanding the current behavior and patterns, we can make predictions about the future.

Another example would be the case of an engineering project, if we have knowledge about the current state of the project and the known problems and constraints, we can use this to extrapolate what might happen if the project is continued in the future. By understanding the current status and the potential risks, we can make informed decisions about the future of the project.

In summary, derivationational extrapolation is a process of making predictions or推测s based on known facts and observations, which can help us make informed decisions about the future.

accent mark, a diacritical mark used to indicate stress or placed above a vowel to indicate a special pronunciation derivationally related form stress, put stress on; utter with an accent; "In Farsi, you accent the last syllable of each word"	The derived form of a word is the one that is based on the original word by adding an extra phoneme (in this case, a syllable) to the end. For example, the derived form of the word "cat" is "kitten", which has two extra phonemes at the end: the phoneme "t" and the phoneme "k".

In Farsi, the language with which I'm familiar, the stress is placed on the last syllable of each word. This is because in Farsi, the stress is not on the end of the word as it is in many other languages, but on the last syllable of each 音节 (phoneme), which is also the most recent 音节 in the word. For example, the word "farsi" ( Farsi) has two 音节： "far" (声母) and "si" (韵母), and the stress is on the "si" 韵母， which is the most recent 音节 in the word.

So, to utter a word in Farsi with an accent, you would accent the last syllable of each word, as in the example I gave you: "farsi -- tesi -- cat" ( Farsi -- tesi -- kitten).

chromatic, being or having or characterized by hue derivationally related form vividness, chromatic purity: freedom from dilution with white and hence vivid in hue	The relationship between vividness, chromatic purity, and freedom from dilution with white can be derived from the色彩理论 of art. In this理论， the vividness of an image is related to its chromatic purity, which is defined as the degree to which the colors in an image are pure and distinct from one another. A pure color is one that is not dilution with white, as white is a color that is made up of a combination of three other colors, black, yellow, and white.

In terms of art, this means that an image that is highly pure and free from dilution with white will be more vivid and striking to the eye than an image that is not as pure. For example, a pure blue color will be more vivid than a blue that is dilution with white, as white will reduce the contrast between the blue color and the surrounding colors.

Another factor that can affect the vividness of an image is the艺术家's choice of medium. For example, an艺术家 who uses a pure and distinct color palette in their创作 will be more likely to create images that are highly vivid and striking. On the other hand, an艺术家 who uses a more dilute and混在一起的 color palette may be more likely to create images that are more subtle and nuanced, but still have a good deal of vividness to them.

Overall, the relationship between vividness, chromatic purity, and freedom from dilution with white can be seen as a complex and dynamic interplay between these factors.

They both held atomsistic theories, which suggest that all matter is composed of tiny discrete finite indivisible indestructible particles. Democritus believed that the universe was made up of many small particles, each of which was indivisible and had no mass. Epicurus, on the other hand, believed that the universe was made up of a few large particles, called atoms, which were each indivisible and had a very small mass. These atoms were thought to be the basic building blocks of everything in the universe.

The relationship between Democritus' and Epicurus'Atomistic theories and modern chemistry is not well-established, as the theories are much older than modern chemistry. However, it is possible that their ideas have influenced modern chemistry, particularly in the study of the structure of atoms and the properties of matter.

transmute, alter the nature of (elements) derivationally related form transmutation, (physics) the change of one chemical element into another (as by nuclear decay or radioactive bombardment); "the transmutation of base metals into gold proved to be impossible"	The concept of transmutation, also known as the transmutation of elements, is a fundamental concept in the study of chemistry and physics. It refers to the change of one chemical element into another, usually through the process of nuclear decay or radioactive bombardment.

In the context of transmutation, the term "base metals" refers to the metals such as silver, gold, and lead that are commonly used in our daily lives. These metals are known to be stable, meaning that they do not change into another element through chemical reaction. However, through transmutation, an element can be transformed into another that is more stable, such as gold.

The fact that the transmutation of base metals into gold proved to be impossible is a result of the fact that gold is more stable than base metals such as silver and lead. Therefore, it is not possible to transform a base metal into gold through a chemical reaction. This means that the transmutation of elements is not possible in the real world, as it would require a reaction that is too fast or too slow to occur.

Overall, the concept of transmutation is a fundamental aspect of chemistry and physics that plays a role in our understanding of the nature of elements and the way they react. It is important to keep in mind that the transmutation of elements is not possible in the real world, but this does not prevent us from exploring the properties and behavior of elements in the laboratory.

stretch, make long or longer by pulling and stretching; "stretch the fabric" derivationally related form extension, an addition to the length of something	The concept of derivationally related form and extension is related to the study of mathematical structures, particularly in the context of fields like calculus and analysis. In this context, a derivationally related form is a mathematical formula or function that is defined using the same basic operations as a higher-level formula or function, but with a different set of variables or parameters. For example, the derivative of a function f(x)f(x) can be defined as the rate of change of the function at a given point, using the formula d/dx[f(x)]d/dx[f(x)], which represents the change in the function value over a given period of time. In this way, derivationally related forms are like更高级别的公式或函数的子函数，它们使用相同的基本操作来定义，但具有不同的变量或参数。例如，函数的导数可以定义为该函数在给定点处的速率变化，使用公式d/dx[f(x)]d/dx[f(x)]，表示对函数值的变化率。因此，derivably related forms are like更高级别的公式或函数的子函数，它们使用相同的基本操作来定义，但具有不同的变量或参数。

This concept is also relevant to the field of computer science, where software languages and programming techniques often use derivationally related forms and extensions to provide a more powerful and flexible way of working with mathematical concepts. For example, the programming language Python has a built-in derivative()function that allows developers to derivative a function easily, while the programming language R has a built-in ggplot2() function that allows users to create beautiful graphics using mathematical equations. These derivationally related forms and extensions provide a convenient and powerful way for developers to work with mathematical concepts and create more advanced and innovative software applications.

failure, an unexpected omission; "he resented my failure to return his call"; "the mechanic's failure to check the brakes" hypernym skip, a mistake resulting from neglect	Hypernym skip, also known as wordhypernym error, is a type of命名实体识别 (NER) error that occurs when a word in a text is recognized as a different word in the same text, even if the words are only separated by a common hypernym. For example, if a text mentions "apple" and "orange," and a NER algorithm误将"apple"识别为"orange," the result will be a hypernym skip.

Hypernyms are groups of words that are related in meaning and are typically used to define concepts or ideas. In the example above, "apple" and "orange" are hypernyms of "apple" because they both refer to the same fruit, while "orange" is a hypernym of "orange" because it has a different meaning and is used to define an idea or concept.

speed, travel at an excessive or illegal velocity; "I got a ticket for speeding" derivationally related form velocity, distance travelled per unit time	The relationship between velocity and distance Travelled per unit time can be derived using the following formula:

d = v × t

Where d is the distance traveled, v is the velocity, and t is the time taken.

This formula is derived from the first law of motion, which states that the total change in distance over a given time is equal to the change in speed over a given time. By multiplying the change in distance by the change in time, we get the formula for distance traveled per unit time.

The person who derived this relationship was probably someone named John Clerk Maxwell, who in 1865 developed the theory of electromagnetic radiation and the formula for the electric and magnetic fields that we now know as the电磁场理论. This theory allowed him to calculate the speed of light, which is a fundamental concept in modern physics, and is the basis of many other theories in physics, such as the theory of relativity.

It's important to note that a Denier is not always a person who is against the scientific method or against science in general. Many Deniers are simply people who have different beliefs or understandings of the world, and who find it difficult to accept the evidence and findings of science.
tape, register electronically; "They recorded her singing" derivationally related form record, sound recording consisting of a disk with a continuous groove; used to reproduce music by rotating while a phonograph needle tracks in the groove	The earliest known form of record was the ancient Greek record, called a gnomon. A gnomon was a thin disk with a continuous groove in its center that was used to record audio signals. The groove was made by cutting a path through the disk with a sharp tool. Greek gnomon records were made of lead or silver and were used to record words, music, and other audio signals.

In the early 20th century, the development of the phonograph record made it possible for people to record and reproduce audio signals on a disk. The phonograph record was a thick, round disk with a continuous groove in its center. The groove was made with a special tool that was carefully designed to track the position of the needle in the groove. When the record was played, the needle would track the sound waves and play the recorded audio信号.

The Phonograph was a big step forward in audio recording technology, and it quickly became the standard for sound recording and reproduction. It was also the first major format to include both audio and video signals, making it a versatile device for recording and reproduce all types of information. Today, the phonograph record is still a popular format for sound recordings and is used in many different applications, including music, video, and home theater systems.

The hypernym for "arithmetic" is " arithmetic" or "numerate." The sentence "the problems at the end of the chapter demonstrated the mathematical processes involved in the derivation" could also be interpreted as "the chapter demonstrated the mathematical processes involved in the derivation," where "Chapter" could be a hypernym for "book."

flow, cause to flow; "The artist flowed the washes on the paper" derivationally related form flowing, the motion characteristic of fluids (liquids or gases)	The derivation of fluid motion, including the concept of flow, is related to the study of the behavior of matter under the influence of gravity and pressure. This study is called physics, and the theories and concepts developed in physics are used to describe the flow of fluids.

In general, fluid motion is caused by the force of gravity working against the resistance of the fluid. This force is known as the重力 force, and it acts across the fluid and creates a motion that is described by the laws of physics. The specific rules and laws that govern fluid motion include the牛顿液体力学 laws, which describe the behavior of液体 under pressure and gravity.

In addition to the重力 force, fluid motion is also influenced by other factors such as the pressure of the fluid, the temperature of the fluid, and the shape of the container in which the fluid is flowing. These factors can all affect the behavior of the fluid and create different types of flow patterns.

Overall, the derivation of fluid motion is a complex process that requires the study of the behavior of matter under pressure and gravity, as well as the use of advanced mathematical models and theories. This study is performed by物理学家 who use their knowledge of the physical laws and principles that govern the behavior of matter to describe the flow of fluids and their various properties.

For example, if we are working with a group $G$, and we have a function $f:G\times G\to G$ that takes two elements $g,h\in G$ and returns an element $f(g,h)\in G$, then we can say that $f$ is a derivationally related form of the group $G$ because it is a function that generates a sub group of $G$ under composition. In other words, $f$ generates the group operation on $G$ by mapping each pair of elements in $G$ to the same element of $G$ under the operation.

Another example of a derivationally related form is a derivational extension of a group. A derivational extension of a group $G$ is a group $H$ that is a derived extension of $G$ meaning that there is a function $f:G\times G\to H$ that takes an element $g\in G$ and returns an element $h\in H$ such that $gh=f(g,h)$ for all $g\in G$ and $h\in H$ (in other words, the derived group operation is satisfied on the extension).
